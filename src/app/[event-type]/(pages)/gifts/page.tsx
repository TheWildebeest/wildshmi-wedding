        <Paragraph>
          We have decided to establish a clear gift-giving etiquette for our
          wedding. This is intended to prevent potential misunderstandings and
          to make things easier for our guests and ourselves.

        <InfoBox title="Good to know:" type="info">
          Gift giving is entirely optional. Being invited to the wedding does
          not mean you are expected to provide a gift.
        </InfoBox>
        <Paragraph>
          If you RSVP to attend the wedding, the <strong>only</strong>{" "}
          expectation of you is that you will indeed attend (you are also
          welcome to arrange for Sofia Vergara or Matt Damon to attend on your
          behalf). Neither Lakshmi nor David expect to get married multiple
          times, and so this is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience for them!
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          So, come and join us, dance with us, sing with us, take selfies and
          post them with #wildshmi on instagram. Indulge us in experiences that
          become memories, that become stories we hope to recount long into the
          future.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          Some people may feel that they want to contribute a gift as well. We
          have provided some options for you to do so if you wish. Please take a
