      <Paragraph>
        As you prepare for your trip to the bustling city of London for our
        upcoming wedding, we&lsquo;ve put together some travel tips and
        recommendations to help you make the most of your time here.

        üõ¨ International arrivals
      </Text>
      <Paragraph>
        Most international flights terminate at Gatwick or Heathrow, which are
        the most convenient airports to fly in to. Both airports have a premium
        &ldquo;express&rdquo; train service to central London, but there are
        also regular train services which are generally cheaper and more
        convenient, as well as taxi and bus services.
      </Paragraph>
      <InfoBox title="Good to know:" type="info">
        For the Gatwick Express and Heathrow Express you need to purchase a
        ticket before boarding the train, otherwise you will receive a fine.
      </InfoBox>
      <Text tagName="h3" size="M">
        ‚úàÔ∏è Gatwick
      </Text>
      <Paragraph>
        Train services at Gatwick run from the South Terminal. Transport between
        the terminals is free ‚Äî just follow the signs.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The <Link href="https://www.gatwickexpress.com/">Gatwick express</Link>{" "}
        runs direct to London Victoria, which is close to Westminster and
        Buckingham Palace ‚Äî a great option if you want to start with some
        sightseeing. Travel takes 30 minutes.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Alternatively, you can take a regular train service. Thameslink trains
        run to London Bridge, which has great transport links to the rest of
        London. This is a good option if you are heading to a hotel in Greenwich
        or somewhere else nearby the wedding reception venue.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        For regular train services (i.e. anything other than Gatwick Express),
        you can just tap in at the gates with your contactless debit/credit
        card. Just make sure you tap out at your destination too. Travel to
        London takes roughly 45 minutes for regular train services.
      </Paragraph>
      <Text tagName="h3" size="M">
        ‚úàÔ∏è Heathrow
      </Text>
      <Paragraph>
        The <Link href="https://www.heathrowexpress.com">Heathrow express</Link>{" "}
        runs direct to London Paddington and takes only 15 minutes. From there
        you can take a stroll in Hyde Park or Regent&lsquo;s Park, or head over
        to Baker Street and check out the Sherlock Holmes Museum.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        If you&lsquo;re not in a rush, you can instead take the Elizabeth Line,
        which also runs to Paddington as well as other stops, including Bond
        Street. For this option, you can just tap in at the gates with your
        contactless debit/credit card, and then tap out at your destination.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        You can even take the London Underground or &ldquo;tube&rdquo; from
        Heathrow via the Picadilly Line. Again, just tap in and out with your
        contactless card. This will be much slower, but much cheaper too.
      </Paragraph>
      <Text tagName="h2" size="L">
        üèôÔ∏è Getting around London
      </Text>
      <InfoBox title="Good to know:" type="info">
        Using Google Maps or CityMapper will make it much easier getting around
        by bus and tube.
      </InfoBox>
      <Paragraph>
        It is not necessary to purchase an Oyster Card or other form of travel
        card when visiting London these days. It&lsquo;s far more convenient and
        equally cost-effective to use a contactless debit or credit card or
        device for getting around the city.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        However, if this isn&lsquo;t suitable because of international
        transaction fees or something, you should sort out a
        <Link href="https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/visiting-london/visitor-oyster-card">
          {" "}
          visitor oyster card
        </Link>{" "}
        before you leave ‚Äî this will be sent to your home address and you will
        benefit from daily price caps. Start with ¬£15-¬£30 credit for a two- to
        four-day trip, and you can top up as needed.
      </Paragraph>
      <Text tagName="h2" size="M">
        üöáTrain and Tube
      </Text>
      <InfoBox title="Remember:" type="info">
        Tap on, tap off, always use the same card.
      </InfoBox>
      <Paragraph>
        Similarly to most metro/subway systems, most train and London
        Underground stations have barriers where you can tap a contactless card
        or device to gain access to or exit from a station.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Some stations have no barriers, and some or don&lsquo;t use them all of
        the time, but you still need to tap your card or device on entry and
        exit on the yellow card reader, in order to be charged the correct fare.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Make sure you always use the same payment method during your time in
        London. There is a daily and weekly{" "}
        <Link href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/find-fares/tube-and-rail-fares/pay-as-you-go-caps">
          price cap
        </Link>{" "}
        which is automatically applied but if you use multiple payment methods,
        you could end up spending more than you need to.
      </Paragraph>
      <Text tagName="h2" size="M">
        üöå Bus
      </Text>
      <InfoBox title="Remember:" type="info">
        Just tap once!
      </InfoBox>
      <Paragraph>
        You only need to tap on when you board a bus ‚Äî it&lsquo;s a fixed fare.
        Unlike trains and the Tube, you don&lsquo;t tap off.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Like trains and the Tube, though, bus fares are also covered by a{" "}
        <Link href="https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/find-fares/tube-and-rail-fares/pay-as-you-go-caps">
          price cap

        , so make sure you use the same payment method on all transport in
        London.

        üè® Accommodation
      </Text>
      <Paragraph>
        We recommend staying in the Greenwich area, close to our reception venue
        (Greenwich Yacht Club) ‚Äî so you can make a quick and easy journey back
        to your hotel after a whole evening of merriment at our wedding! It also
        makes the prospect of a low-key post-nuptial brunch with the newlyweds
        all the more likely.

        sweater just in case. Comfortable shoes are also recommended if there is
        a lot of walking (or dancing) involved.
