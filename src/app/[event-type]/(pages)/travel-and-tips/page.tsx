        As you prepare for your trip to the bustling city of London for our
        upcoming wedding, we&lsquo;ve put together some travel tips and
        recommendations to help you make the most of your time here.

        ðŸ›¬ International arrivals
      </Text>
      <Paragraph>
        Most international flights terminate at Gatwick or Heathrow, which are
        the most convenient airports to fly in to.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Both airports have an express train service connecting to central
        London, for which you have to buy a ticket in advance, in addition to
        regular train services.

      <Paragraph>
        You can also just take a regular train service, and use your contactless
        card to tap in at the station. Look for the Elizabeth Line at Heathrow,
        or at Gatwick follow the signs for Trains and the South Terminal.

      <Paragraph>
        You ca Stansted and Luton are two other airports which also serve
        London-bound travellers. From there, you can take a taxi or public
        transportation such as the Tube or a train to your hotel or
        accommodation. Contactless card payment is accepted at the fairgates and
        in taxis.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Parents will frequently bestow daughters with this providential namesake
        in the hope of manifesting a destiny that sees them grow up to become
        rich and successful.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Imagine, growing up seeing your name associated primarily with a literal
        goddess who has gold coins pouring out of her hands. You&lsquo;d be
        forgiven for occasionally wondering whether this might be a hard act to
        follow.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Not so for <i>this</i> Lakshmi, who has made it her life&lsquo;s goal to
        place the mother of all ticks in the archetypes box by pursuing a career
        in investment banking. At the time of writing, she&lsquo;s a VP in
        Electronic Trading at Bank of America. It sounds impressive, though
        no-one actually knows what it means.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Born in Thiruvananthapuram, capital of the state of Kerala in India,
        Lakshmi is a true citizen of the world. She spent her childhood between
        India, South Africa, and Oman, and left to study in Singapore, where she
        then worked for a number of years. In 2017 she moved to Hong Kong for a
        couple of years, before relocating to London.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Lakshmi had been something of a rebel during her school days. When the
        time came to apply to universities, a family friend suggested she apply
        to a relatively mediocre university (NTU) in Singapore. Instead, she
        ended up accidentally applying to one of the top ten Engineering courses
        in the world, and winning a full scholarship that propelled her to
        success. As an Alumnus of the National University of Singapore, Lakshmi
        lays claim to a status whose pedagogical pedigree is as impressive as
        its acronym is unfortunate.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        What does a bona-fide goddess of wealth look for in a man, than?
        Fortunately for David, she cares more about personality than paycheck,
        and even then, the personality requirements aren&lsquo;t particularly
        stringent. From as early as she can remember, Lakshmi has always known
        what see wanted in a man. At school when her friends would ask her what
        type of guy she wanted to marry, her answer was always the same:
        &ldquo;A funny guy&rdquo;.
      </Paragraph>
      <Text tagName="h3" size="M">
        David&lsquo;s origin story
      </Text>
      <Paragraph>
        Though not a golden goddess, David&lsquo;s name also comes with a hefty
        pedigree â€” that of David, King of Israel, from the Bible. The story goes
        that he rose from humble origins as a shepherd boy and there&lsquo;s a
        famous story about him using his shepherd&lsquo;s slingshot to kill the
        phillistine giant Goliath.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Perhaps the main area where the regal and non-regal Davids differ is in
        the caliber of giants they heave defeated. David reluctantly concedes
        the point that demolishing a footlong Subway sandwich really isn&lsquo;t
        as impressive as toppling Goliath.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Much like his namesake, though, David loves playing stringed
        instruments, the guitar in particular. He&lsquo;s learned to play one or
        two famous guitar solos quite well, and he is quite pretty chuffed with
        this achievement.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        David was born in Liverpool and grew up on the Isle of Man. After
        visiting China at the age of 16, he opted to study Chinese at the
        University of Cambridge. Cambridge was the sixth best university in the
        world during David&lsquo;s time there. Thankfully, nearly a decade on,
        Cambridge has recovered from the impact of David&lsquo;s tenure, and it
        now comes in at third place.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Starting his career in media sales, David spent three years selling
        digital advertising to clients in Jersey, Guernsey, London, and even the
        Isle of Man; eventually branching out further afield and visiting
        Moscow, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing, and Shanghai.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        It was as stressful as it sounds, and David is relieved to be on the
        other side of a career change which he started in early 2019. Starting
        from scratch with a course in software development that he completed
        during the first lockdown, David is now gainfully employed in his second
        Software Developer role. He loves JavaScript almost as much as he once
        loved Mandarin Chinese, but far less than he loves his golden goddess
        Lakshmi.

        How they met
      </Text>
      <Paragraph className={merienda}>
        &ldquo;We met the old fashioned way â€” on Tinder!&rdquo;
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Lakshmi and David have been together (pretty much literally) from when
        they first met in the Three Tuns pub in Aldgate East in London, on
        November 3rd 2020.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        With nowhere to sit inside, they took their pints outside to the beer
        garden, with nothing but the warmth of each others&lsquo; company and an
        array of carefully positioned halogen lamps to ward off the chill of the
        November air.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        They took an instant liking to one another. Lakshmi was impressed by
        David&lsquo;s biceps, and David was bowled over by Lakshmi&lsquo;s
        generous compliments.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Lakshmi approached David with a proposition that he simply
        couldn&lsquo;t refuse. She told him she had an Xbox One and a new game
        had just come out that was co-operative multiplayer.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        &ldquo;Beer and video games !? I&lsquo;d better hold on to this
        one!&rdquo;, David thought to himself.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Over the next two months, David and Lakshmi got to know each other as
        Leo and Vincent, the playable protagonist characters in A Way Out. As
        Leo and Vincent, they met each other for the first time again, escaped
        from prison together, evaded police, and tracked down a crime boss, all
        while navigating the twists and turns of the characters&lsquo;
        relationship.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The following two years, meanwhile, have seen David and Lakshmi get to
        know each other in real life. This has thankfully featured far less
        violence and fewer encounters with police (apart from that one time).
        Nevertheless, the journey has been equally if not more exhilarating, as
        they stepped outside their comfort zones, daring to trust and support
        one another enough to be able to start planning a future together.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In many ways, it has been all-or-nothing since the start. The day after
        their first date, a national lockdown came into effect. This was the
        second such lockdown of the Covid-19 pandemic, and though we all knew
        the drill by this point, Lakshmi and David were faced with forming a
        &ldquo;support bubble&rdquo; in order to be able to continue seeing each
        other, or waiting until after lockdown. Who would have known that the
        humble bubble which once supported Lakshmi and David&lsquo;s nascent
        relationship was to be a progenitor of nuptials?
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Because of the lockdown, their first months were spent in close quarters
        at each others&lsquo; flats, playing games, cooking exotic meals
        together, watching TV shows. It was only later as restrictions eased
        that they began to venture out to explore the streets of East London,
        visiting the docks to feed the ducks, and taking evening strolls by the
        river and across Tower Bridge.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In the summer of 2022 they had the opportunity to meet each
        others&lsquo; parents, with Haridas and Latha flying over from
        Trivandrum and Chris and Martine from the Isle of Man, to spend some
        time testing the waters as in-laws. They knew it would work out when
        David cooked dinner for the parents one evening and brought together
        both mothers&lsquo; signature recipes in one meal â€” Martine&lsquo;s
        lentil pasta sauce taking on a new role as daal, alongside Latha&lsquo;s
        lamb biryani.

      <Text tagName="h2" size="M">
        Getting engaged
      </Text>
      <Paragraph>
        The decision to get married happened organically and gradually as
        Lakshmi and David got to know each other, but as 2022 drew to a close
        they started thinking of making it a reality.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        2023 kicked off with choosing the date, and as February edged ever
        closer, David started planning a proper proposal to surprise Lakshmi
        with a ring on Valentine&lsquo;s day.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Secretly booking the day off work for both of them, David arrange a day
        full of romantic activities â€” breakfast at sunrise in a fortieth-floor
        restaraunt, a massage workshop with roses, prosecco, and chocolates, a
        game of chess which <del>he let Lakshmi win</del>{" "}
        <ins
          style={{
            textDecoration: "none",

          Lakshmi won fair and square
        </ins>
        , and an afternoon tea with a special diamond-based dessert!
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        It was the perfect day and they celebrated afterwards with another
        surprise â€” a trip back to where it all started at The Three Tuns, where
        Lakshmi&lsquo;s friends and colleagues were waiting with prosecco on
        standby to surprise her.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Going straight from one whirlwind experience to another, David and
        Lakshmi then jetted off to India in March 2023 along with David&lsquo;s
        parents, sister, and two brothers, for an &ldquo;official&rdquo;
        engagement ceremony with Lakshmi&lsquo;s extended family. This
        conveniently doubled up as a massive birthday bash for Lakshmi&lsquo;s
        mother Latha.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        You can check out the photos from the proposal and the engagement party
        on the photos page.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Then, make sure you fill in the RSVP form so you can join Lakshmi and
        David in creating more happy memories (and taking more awesome photos)
        with them at the wedding on 26 August.
