    <Paragraph>
      All of the greatest heroes have a really cool origin story.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Unfortunately, Lakshmi and David are <i>not</i> superheroes, regardless of how they may privately view themselves and/or each other.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Take it from someone who knows them pretty darn well — they&lsquo;re just a couple of regular folk.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Notwithstanding their underwhelming averageness, if you&lsquo;re not equally well acquainted with both Lakshmi and David, there are probably a couple of interesting facts about them that you don&lsquo;t know.
    </Paragraph>

    <Text tagName='h3' size='M'>Lakshmi&lsquo;s origin story</Text>
    <Paragraph>
      Lakshmi is named after the Hindu goddess of wealth. Below, you can see a traditional representation of Lakshmi — flush with cash, and remarkably zen about it.

    <Paragraph>
      Parents will frequently bestow daughters with this providential namesake in the hope of manifesting a destiny that sees them grow up to become rich and successful.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Imagine, growing up seeing your name associated primarily with a literal goddess who has gold coins pouring out of her hands. You&lsquo;d be forgiven for occasionally wondering whether this might be a hard act to follow.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Not so for <i>this</i> Lakshmi, who has made it her life&lsquo;s goal to place the mother of all ticks in the archetypes box by pursuing a career in investment banking. At the time of writing, she&lsquo;s a VP in Electronic Trading at Bank of America, and impatient as ever that she <i>still</i> hasn&lsquo;t bagged that Director role yet.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Born in Thiruvananthapuram, capital of the state of Kerala in India, Lakshmi is a true citizen of the world. She spent her childhood between India and Oman, and spent a year in South Africa as a late teenager. She left to study in Singapore, where she then worked for a number of years, before moving to Hong Kong and then finally to London. 
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Despite being something of a rebel during her school days, the sheer strength of her fierce intelligence propelled her to success, winning a scholarship to study one of the most highly ranked Computer Science courses in the world at the National University of Singapore. As an <strong>A</strong>lumnus of the <strong>N</strong>ational <strong>U</strong>niversity of <strong>S</strong>ingapore, Lakshmi lays claim to a status the pedagogical pedigree of which is as impressive as its acronym is unfortunate.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      What does a bona-fide goddess of wealth look for in a man, than? Fortunately for David, she cares more about personality than paycheck, and even then, the personality requirements aren&lsquo;t particularly stringent. From as early as she can remember, Lakshmi has always known what see wanted in a man. At school when her friends would ask her what type of guy she wanted to marry, her answer was always the same: &ldquo;A funny guy&rdquo;.

    <Text tagName='h3' size='M'>David&lsquo;s origin story</Text>
    <Paragraph>
      Though not a golden godess, David&lsquo;s name also comes with a hefty pedigree — that of David, King of Israel, from the Bible. The story goes that he rose from humble origins as a shepherd boy and there&lsquo;s a famous story about him using his shepherd&lsquo;s slingshot to kill the Phillistine giant Goliath.
    </Paragraph>
    <AccessibleImage image={kingdavid} altText="King David playing the harp" captionText="Biblical David was known to play the harp" />
    <Paragraph>
      Much like his namesake, David loves playing stringed instruments, the guitar in particular. He&lsquo;s learned to play one or two famous guitar solos quite well, and he is quite chuffed with himself as a result.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      One area where the regal and non-regal Davids differ is in the caliber of giants they pick as enemies. The only giant David has slain is his own expectations of becoming rich and successful before the age of 35.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      David was born in Liverpool and grew up on the Isle of Man, where he loves to return to
